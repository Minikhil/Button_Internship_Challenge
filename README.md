ExpressionEvaluator:

Button's 2018 Engineering Intern Coding Challenge. The goal of this program is to evaluates prefix expressions

Contents:

ExpressionEvaluator.py
input.txt - is an input file of valid expressions. It may contain only one expression on each line
output.txt - is a file the answers to the expressions will be written in.
README.md - file you are currently reading

Deployment:

1. Write the expression you want to evaluate in the input.txt file. You can evaluate multiple expressions at once but each expression should be on its own line in the input file

   The Input file already has some expression written in it

2. Execute the program by running the command python    ExpressionEvaluator.py

3. The result of each expression will be printed in the output.txt file
